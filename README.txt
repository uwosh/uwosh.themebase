Introduction
============

This product provides the base functionality that all other uwosh plone sites should use.


Using the random images
-----------------------

For the images to show up on the site, you need to add a folder with the id 'main-images' and then add your images there.  This folder can be overridden at any place in the site, so you can have a different set of random images show up in different places.


Live Search
===========
To enable the livesearch to work along with google search of all campus sites, I customized the livesearch.js file which is located
in the skins directory.

I dynamically bind and unbind search keys.
